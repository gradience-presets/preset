# Gradience Presets 

Presets are managed through a GitHub project, and app submissions take place as pull requests. To submit an preset:

1. Fork this repository on GitHub
2. Clone the fork: `git clone --branch=new-pr git@github.com:your_github_username/preset.git`
3. Create a new branch with your appâ€™s name: git checkout -b your_app_name
4. Add your preset to the branch, and a README commit it and push the commit.
5. Open a pull request against the new-pr branch on Github
6. Your pull request will then be reviewed by the Gradience Team

Once your pull request has been approved, a new repository will be created for your preset, containing your preset. You will have write access for the repository.
